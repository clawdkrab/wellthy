# 🧭 WELLTHY — ONBOARDING & PAYWALL BUILD PROMPT (V1)

## READ FIRST (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Onboarding and paywall are structural, not cosmetic.

Their job is to:
- align the right users
- build commitment
- justify payment
- preserve trust
- avoid App Store rejection

They are not for:
- hype
- pressure
- urgency
- over-explaining features

---

## ONBOARDING PRINCIPLES (LOCKED)
- Onboarding is not education
- Onboarding is alignment
- Each screen has one job only
- If a screen has two jobs, it is wrong
- No pricing in onboarding
- No forced actions
- Calm, confident, non-salesy tone

---

## ONBOARDING FLOW (8 SCREENS — DO NOT ADD MORE)

### SCREEN 1 — IDENTITY MATCH

**UI notes:**
- Full screen
- Minimal text
- Bright, arty background
- No buttons except "Continue"

---

### SCREEN 2 — PAIN ARTICULATION

**Purpose:** Name the frustration they already feel.

**Copy:**
> Most fitness apps track effort —
> but give nothing back.

**Subtext:**
> Numbers don't create motivation. Progress does.

**UI notes:**
- Calm, neutral tone

---

### SCREEN 3 — REFRAME

**Secondary CTA:**
> Explore first

**Rules:**
- No pricing
- No subscription mention

---

## PAYWALL PHILOSOPHY (CRITICAL)

A paywall should feel like:
> "This works. I want more."

Not:
> "I'm blocked."

### RULES
- Paywall only appears after value is experienced
- No urgency language
- No countdowns
- No "limited time"
- Always provide a free path

---

## PAYWALL TRIGGER (LOCKED)

Trigger paywall after:
- User completes Day 2
- User has:
  - a streak
  - earned credits
  - seen Collect screen

Never earlier.

---

## PAYWALL SCREEN STRUCTURE (ONE SCREEN ONLY)

### HEADER

**Headline:**
> Go further with Wellthy+

**Subtext:**
> Optional upgrades for deeper progress and faster rewards.

**Tone:**
- calm
- optional
- confident

---

### VALUE STACK (3 BULLETS MAX)

---

**Bullet 2:**
